    <h1>Privacy Policy for Walkie Talkie Bluetooth by GizanTech</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: August 30, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <p>GizanTech ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Walkie Talkie Bluetooth mobile application ("App") on Android devices. Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not save any personal information, as the App does not use a web server or API. We may collect the following information solely for in-App functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth Information:</strong> We collect device-specific Bluetooth information, such as your device’s Bluetooth identifier, to enable connectivity and display within the App. This information is not stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect temporary information about how you use the App, such as chat interactions, voice message activity, or image attachments, to facilitate real-time communication. This data is not saved.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Data:</strong> Voice messages, images, or text you send or receive through the App are processed in real-time to enable communication but are not stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> If you enable location sharing for specific features, we may collect your device’s approximate location to enhance social interactions or group chats. Location data is only collected with your explicit consent and is not stored.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable Bluetooth-based communication, including chat, voice messages, and image attachments.</li>
        <li>Provide and maintain the App’s functionality and user experience.</li>
        <li>Facilitate social media-like interactions, such as connecting with other users or joining group chats.</li>
        <li>Ensure the security of the App and prevent unauthorized access or misuse.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No information is stored or retained after use.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not save, sell, or rent your information. We may share your information in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Other Users:</strong> Information you share in chats, voice messages, or image attachments may be visible to other users in the App based on your settings (e.g., public or private channels).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or government request.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If GizanTech is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but only to the extent it exists in real-time use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures, including encryption for voice messages and image attachments, to protect your information during real-time use. No data is stored, and no method of transmission over Bluetooth or the internet is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth Access:</strong> You can manage Bluetooth permissions through your device’s settings to control connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Sharing:</strong> You can disable location sharing in the App settings or your device’s settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You may stop using the App at any time. Uninstalling the App will prevent further data collection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not retain any personal information or content data (e.g., voice messages, images). All data is processed in real-time and discarded after use.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for use by individuals under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please review their privacy policies before engaging with them.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the updated policy in the App or through other communication channels. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
